  * [a415013]: Merge branch 'topic--restorecond-init-script'

    restorecond is started in runlevels "S" and 2 3 4 5.  When started in
    "S" it works correctly, but when started by one of the others
    start-stop-daemon exits with code 1 because it's already running. The
    fix was to simply add --oknodo to the start-stop-daemon invocations.

policycoreutils (1.32-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "policycoreutils: fixfiles should warn if no suitable fs
    found", thanks to David Härdeman. This was a missing simple check --
    now fixfiles does not attempt to run setfiles on an empty set if it
    did not find a valid directory. Low risk, simple test. (Closes: #397198).
  * Bug fix: "policycoreutils: audit2allow line 135 should refer to debian
    package", thanks to Russell Coker. It now asks the users to install
    the checkpolicy package, not the chckpolicy rpm package.
                                                           (Closes: #401369).
  * Bug fix: "policycoreutils: patch for semanage.8", thanks to Russell
    Coker. This adds some options that had been missing from the man page.
                                                           (Closes: #406702).
  * Bug fix: "policycoreutils: fixfiles excludes reiserfs", thanks to
    David Härdeman. Actually, it should: Support for atomic inode labeling
    has not been implemented in reiserfs, so there is no SELinux support
    for it.  This is documented in selinux-doc.  Reiser just won't label
    files when they are created making it basically worthless for xattr
    labeling.                                              (Closes: #397196).

    to Uwe Hermann. Perhaps not.                           (Closes: #386929).

    * Merged fix for restorecon // handling from Erich Schubert.
    * Merged translations update and fixfiles fix from Dan Walsh.
  * Fix the initial /etc/selinux/config to refer to
    SELINUXTYPE=refpolicy-targeted to match what we ship (as opposed to
    paths on red hat installations).
  * Bug fix: "Can't open '/etc/selinux/targeted/policy/policy.20': No such
    file or directory", thanks to Uwe Hermann            (Closes: #384852).
  * Add md5sums
  * With this version of policycoreutils, the file /etc/selinux/config
    shall have the variable SELINUXTYPE set to refpolicy-targeted (you may
    also set it to be refpolicy-strict or refpolicy-src). Only 1.30.26-3
    created the file with SELINUXTYPE set to targeted (which is
    appropriate on Red Hat machines and not Debian). We can't
    automatically change /etc/selinux/config (preserve user changes) since
    /etc/selinux/targeted/policy/policy.N might be a legitimate local
    security policy. If it is not, and if any of the files
    /etc/selinux/refpolicy-targeted/policy/policy.N,
    /etc/selinux/refpolicy-strict/policy/policy.N, or
    /etc/selinux/refpolicy-src/policy/policy.N exist, please select one
    for the  SELINUXTYPE variable in /etc/selinux/config

policycoreutils (1.20-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * policycoreutils_1.20-2(ia64/unstable): FTBFS: missing build-depends,
    thanks to Lamont Jones. I wonder why this builds on my debootstrap
    installed UML with just build essential ad selinux. (Closes: #291501).

 -- Manoj Srivastava <srivasta@debian.org>  Fri, 21 Jan 2005 10:30:16 -0600

    expect", thanks to YAMASHITA Junji. rewrote open_init_tty in C, and
    added man page. I guess it can be moved to /usr/bin, though I don't
    really see what other purpose it can serve.             (Closes: #255674).
  * Bug fix: "policycoreutils: error in genhomedircon: doesn't recognize
    FIRST_UID", thanks to Thomas Bleher. Since this was packaged from
    scratch, this debian specific flaw has been corrected.  (Closes: #281988).
